This is a blog for my CTF Writeups. I mostly do CTFs from HackTheBox, but I may possibly do some from the OffSec library as well as from TryHackMe.

The goal here is threefold; I hope that by doing writeups, I'll be able to improve my report writing skills, deepen my understanding of the hacking techniques and vulnerabilities featured in the boxes I complete, and to provide a tutorial for others to follow if they're struggling with a particular box.

Thanks for taking the time to checkout my blog :)
